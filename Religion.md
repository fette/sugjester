# Religion

The Catechism
- **My grounding is _the ultimate ensemble._** I believe that all possible universes exist, that each unfolds deterministically in accordance with its own laws, that it’s a privilege to be instantiated as a consciousness in any of them, and that I must regularly return to recognition and gratitude for it.
- **My perspective is _nested and complex._** I strive to always recognize the multiple layers of reality that may seem contradictory but are in fact simultaneously true.
- **My locus of reverence is _the Eternal._** It’s ineffable and intangible, but it can be gotten closer to and triangulated in religion, in science, in nature, in human expression and devotion.
- **My primary interface to the world is _the written word._** I want to explore language, especially written language, for the rest of my life.
- **My ethos is _Heisei moe._** This is a complex concept that Dave and I developed, but it boils down to creating a world where people can pursue small-scale passions purely because they are passionate about them, and can find communities where they feel welcome doing so.
- **My approach to learning and development is _metamorphic._** This means absorbing and then patiently reinventing everything I learn from scratch in order to make it my own.  
- **My method for creativity is _slow incremental revision._** The commit history of a work, ratcheting ever closer to an ideal, is as much a part of the work as the resulting text.  
- **My highest values are _discipline and grace._** Discipline means that when something needs to be done, even if I don't want to do it, I choose to “do it anyway.” Grace means that when doing anything, I aspire to do it in a way that reduces entropy and increases love.  
- **My aesthetic is _books and hugs and rock & roll._** This synthesizes together the importance I put on study, on care, and on emotional expressiveness.

layers to contemplate (seek to improve these sources)
- **identity** a la various figures: clammbon, rush, brown, whyte, et al.
- **humanity** a la pinker, diamond, stephenson, et al.
- **beingness** a la harris, bostrom, yudkowsky, et al.
- **creatureness** a la dawkins
- **life** a la mukherjee, davies
- **particles** a la carroll, greene
- **math** a la tegmark

rituals
- meditation a la harris
- zen a la shukman?
- yoga even?
- concerts as religion — define how to pay attention and be present
- reading as religion — define how to read new material and revisit important readings
- litany of the long fet
- gratitude practice
- looking-forward practice
- immersion in nature — hikes
- immersion in history — museums
- liturgical calendar to tie it all together and define what happens when

perhaps all systems — cadence, be well, texture, discipline, even spending budget — are part of the religion

Detritus at the center

As told to ChatGPT during its interview of me:
I am developing a sort of personal religion based on a piece of software I built called The Detritus. I would actually like your help developing this religion over time, but it incorporates elements such as:
- Focus on The Eternal and pursuing opportunities to be near it
- A calendar of rituals for reinforcing my values and creating a sense of ceremony
- Aesthetics of Catholicism from my background
- Deep understanding of the universe, including especially that presented in Max Tegmark's "Our Mathematical Universe"
- Reverence for nature, history, and human expression
- Cultivation of love and grace
- A personal canon of important works, including books and music that embody or gesture toward the Eternal
